=head1 NAME

AIIA::GMT - a XML-RPC client of a web-service server, AIIA gene mention tagger, which provides the service to recognize named entities in the biomedical articles

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use YAML;
 use AIIA::GMT;

 $result = &text2entity('less than 3000 words');
 print Dump $result;


=head1 DESCRIPTION

AIIA::GMT is a XML-RPC client of a web-service server, AIIA gene mention tagger, which provides the service to recognize named entities in the biomedical articles. 

AIIA gene mention tagger, developed by Adaptive Internet Intelligent Agents Lab, Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taiwan and I-Fang Chung's Lab, Institute of Bioinformatics, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan, is a named entity recognition tool which participated in the BioCreative II challenge evaluation and attained a 0.8683 of F-score (ranked 2nd) in the final system assessment of the Gene Mention task.

This module is developed to help those who want to use this remote service with XML-RPC, rather than with its web interface. Finally, this module and service is released under a GPLv3 License. You're free to use it for both academic or personal use.
